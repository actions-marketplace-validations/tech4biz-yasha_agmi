"""The storage-side hunt: run the nine at-rest edits against one target and
report what the tool served, with a reproduction for each finding.

The front-door hunt (``agmi.agent.hunter``) poisons through the tool's API.
This one is the other side of the API: it edits the tool's storage directly
and asks the tool, through its own read path or audit, whether it noticed.
A finding is an edit the tool served as genuine (or merely lost, never
flagged). It is the same oracle the scorecard uses, driven as a hunt so the
agent covers both families in one run and hands back a script per finding.

Authorisation runs before the target is touched (``agmi.agent.authz``): the
at-rest targets here are all in-process library stores the caller already
holds. A network target would go through the same gate the front-door hunt
uses, and is not reachable from this module.
